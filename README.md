# Gulpstructor
### What?
A tool to speed-up initial Gulp setup for new projects.

### How?
* Select languages, options and additional tools
* Generate setup (edit if necessary)
* Download Gulpfile.js or the whole project folder (as .zip)
* Setup package.json
    * Run `npm init`
    * Run `npm install` generated by Gulpstructor
* Use Gulp as normal

### What's left?
See [Dev_Plan.md](https://github.com/valenber/gulpstructor/blob/master/Dev_Plan.md)

### Future
* Add a few useful plugins
* PostCSS
* Allow users to save new plugins in Local Storage

### Contributing
I didn't have time to test the app extensively yet, so any reports of issues are greatly appreciated as well as requests for new plugins and features.
