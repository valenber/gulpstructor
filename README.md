# Gulpstructor
### What is it?
A gulpfile generator to help you with your next project.

### How do you use it?
* Select languages, options and additional plugins you are planning to use
* Generate the file (edit if necessary)
* Download Gulpfile.js or the whole project folder (as .zip)
* Setup package.json
    * Run `npm init`
    * Run `npm install` generated by Gulpstructor
* Use Gulp as normal

### What's next?
See [Dev_Plan.md](https://github.com/valenber/gulpstructor/blob/master/Dev_Plan.md)

### Contributing
I haven't had time to test the app extensively yet, so bugreports are greatly appreciated, as are ideas for new features and other plugins.
