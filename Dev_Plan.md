#Development Plan

* ~~Show/hide language details~~
* ~~Style the options lists~~
* ~~Basic Gulpfile generator~~
    * ~~Process input data~~
    * ~~Generate require text~~
    * ~~Record file structure~~
    * ~~Generate basic tasks~~
    * ~~List NPM packages~~
* ~~Add watch tasks~~
* ~~Cleanup Gulpfile builder~~
* ~~Combine pipes on the same target category~~
    * ~~Change structure of input.input_object to 'target -> plugin -> options'~~
    * ~~Change library plugin object to add order property~~
* ~~Add extras to DOM~~
* ~~Handler for plugins with multiple pipes/methods~~
* ~~SourceMaps for CSS and JS~~
* ~~Server/Livereload~~
* ~~Default task~~
* Gulpfile output
* Error Handler
* About page
* Make responsive
* Remember to style
    * Generate button
    * Text input for Extras


##Later
* PostCSS
* Server only works with gulp-connect, make alternative options possible

##Bugs
* ~~Options values are rendered in the reverse order due to CSS styling~~
* ~~Pseudo radio buttons for options don't react to clicks~~
* ~~ERROR if user selected nothing~~
* ~~Gulp object is not reset~~
* ~~When an extra plugin is unselected its options stay selected and produce error~~
* JShint reporter 'stylish' will not work, because it requires special plugin
