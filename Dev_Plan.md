#Development Plan

Here I will be listing new ideas and plans for the project

##What's Next? `--in no particular order--`
* Descriptions for
    * Extras
    * Plugin options
* Expand selection of plugins (ECMAScript 6, image processing/sprites, TDD suites)
* Update UI and design
* Add assets folder and image processing plugins
* Hide extras that are irrelevant for selected languages (e.g. Sass can output compressed like cssnano)
* Allow users to type options for plugins and save those options for the future
* Allow users to add plugins of their choice (to be saved in LS)
* PostCSS
* Server currently uses gulp-connect, make alternative options (something for PHP, Vagrant?)

##Remember to style
* Default language selection (HTML, CSS, JS)

##Bugs to fix
